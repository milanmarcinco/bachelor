      "[0/45]: Melting Hadrons, Boiling Quarks: From Hagedorn Temperature to Ultra-Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions at CERN: With a Tribute to Rolf Hagedorn\n",
      "The document discusses the concept of the Hagedorn temperature, a critical limit in the study of hadronic matter, and its significance in understanding the transition to a quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Hagedorn proposed that as energy is added to a system of strongly interacting particles, the temperature does not rise indefinitely; instead, it reaches a plateau at the Hagedorn temperature, approximately between 150 MeV and 160 MeV. This phenomenon implies an exponential increase in the number of hadronic states, necessitating a revision of statistical physics equations to accommodate numerous massive hadron resonances. The Statistical Bootstrap Model (SBM) is introduced to explain how hadrons can become excited into heavier resonances, forming a complex hierarchy of particles. As the temperature approaches the Hagedorn limit, matter transitions from a gas of hadrons to a state of deconfined quarks and gluons, marking the formation of the QGP. Experiments conducted at various high-energy colliders, such as CERN's Super Proton Synchrotron and the Large Hadron Collider, have sought to validate these theoretical predictions by observing signatures of the QGP, including strangeness production and collective flow patterns. These findings indicate that the QGP behaves like a nearly inviscid liquid, with low shear viscosity, supporting the idea of a strongly coupled state of quarks and gluons. The document emphasizes the ongoing exploration into the properties of the QGP and the implications of Hagedorn's work, which has laid foundational insights into the behavior of matter under extreme conditions, akin to those present in the early universe.\n",
